  "description": "Primer is the CSS toolkit that powers GitHub's front-end design. It's purposefully limited to common components to provide our developers with the most flexibility, and to keep GitHub uniquely *GitHubby*. It's built with SCSS and available via Bower, so it's easy to include all or part of it within your own project.",
